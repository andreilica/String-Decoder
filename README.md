# String Decoder

I developed a program that decodes a series of strings that are encoded using different cryptographic methods.

Task 1. XOR between two streams of bytes
	
Task 2. Rolling XOR

Task 3. XOR between two strings represented using hexazecimal characters

Task 4. Decoding of a string represented in base32

Task 5. XOR Bruteforce with one byte key
